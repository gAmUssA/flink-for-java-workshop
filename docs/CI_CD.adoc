== üöÄ Overview

This document describes the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) setup for the Flink for Java Workshop project.
The CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions and is designed to ensure build reliability.

== üîç Workflows

=== 1Ô∏è‚É£ Smoke Test

The Smoke Test workflow (`smoke-test.yml`) is a lightweight test that quickly verifies the build process works correctly.
It runs on both Ubuntu and macOS environments to ensure cross-platform compatibility.

*Trigger Events:*

* Push to `main` branch
* Pull requests to `main` branch
* Manual trigger (workflow_dispatch)

*Steps:*

* Checkout code
* Set up JDK 21
* Setup and validate Gradle
* Install dependencies (using Brewfile on macOS)
* Build the project
* Run tests
* Build shadow JARs
* Upload build artifacts

=== 2Ô∏è‚É£ CI Workflow

The CI workflow (`ci.yml`) is a comprehensive test that includes build tests and Docker build verification.

*Trigger Events:*

* Push to `main` branch
* Pull requests to `main` branch
* Weekly schedule (Sunday at midnight UTC)
* Manual trigger (workflow_dispatch)

*Jobs:*

1. *Build:* Build and test the project
   * Runs on both Ubuntu and macOS
   * Uses Brewfile for macOS dependencies
   * Builds the project and runs tests
   * Creates shadow JARs
   * Uploads build artifacts

2. *Docker:* Tests Docker image building
   * Builds a Docker image using the project's Dockerfile
   * Verifies the image builds successfully

== üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Files

=== GitHub Actions Workflow Files

* `.github/workflows/smoke-test.yml` - Smoke test workflow
* `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - CI workflow

=== Docker Configuration

* `Dockerfile` - Docker image definition for the project

== üß™ Running Locally

To test the build process locally before pushing to GitHub:

[source,bash]
----
# Build the project
./gradlew build

# Run tests
./gradlew test

# Build Docker image
docker build -t flink-for-java-workshop:local .
----

You can also use the Makefile for convenience:

[source,bash]
----
# Build the project
make build

# Build Docker image
make docker-build
----

== üìã Badges

The README includes status badges for both workflows:

* Smoke Test: Shows the status of the smoke test workflow
* CI: Shows the status of the CI workflow

These badges provide at-a-glance visibility into the build status of the project.
