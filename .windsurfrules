# project rules

## Makefile

- use make files when need to execute more than one command
- for Makefiles use emoji and ascii colors for better readability

- use java 21 for building the project
- use gradle with Kotlin for build scripts
- prefer multimodule project structure
- common modules (that will be shared between projects) should be in the `common` directory
- use sdkman for managing SDKs

## Dockerfile and Docker Compose

- prefer to use https://orbstack.dev/   for managing docker containers (instead of docker desktop)
- for managing docker containers use docker compose and don't add version attribute for docker-compose.yaml file
- for kafka in docker use apache/kafka:3.8.0 image in Kraft more withour zookeeper

## Documentation

- use asciidoc (*.adoc) for documentation and use emoji for better readability
- use one sentence per line in asciidoc

- use git for version control
- when working on a new feature create a new branch (feature/feature-name)
- use github cli to interact with github
