= Airline Delay Performance Analysis Use Case
:toc:
:icons: font
:source-highlighter: highlightjs

== Overview 🌟

The Airline Delay Performance Analysis use case demonstrates how to analyze airline on-time performance and delay patterns using Flink's Table API.
This use case showcases analytical queries with stateful processing and time-based windowing to provide deep insights into airline performance.

== Features ⏱️

* Calculate average delay times for each airline
* Determine percentage of delayed flights by airline
* Identify patterns in delays based on time windows and airports

== Implementation Details 🔧

The implementation processes flight records to perform two main analyses:

1. **Airline Delay Performance Metrics**:
   * Group flights by airline
   * Calculate average delay in milliseconds
   * Count total flights and delayed flights
   * Calculate delay percentage for each airline
   * Rank airlines by performance

2. **Time-Windowed Delay Analysis**:
   * Use tumbling time windows (e.g., hourly)
   * Group flights by origin airport within each time window
   * Calculate departure counts and delay percentages
   * Identify congestion periods and delay patterns

== Table API Examples 💻

=== Airline Delay Performance SQL

[source,sql]
----
SELECT 
  airline, 
  AVG(actualDeparture - scheduledDeparture) AS avg_delay_millis, 
  COUNT(*) AS total_flights, 
  SUM(CASE WHEN actualDeparture > scheduledDeparture THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS delayed_flights, 
  (SUM(CASE WHEN actualDeparture > scheduledDeparture THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS delay_percentage 
FROM flight_source 
WHERE actualDeparture IS NOT NULL 
GROUP BY airline 
ORDER BY avg_delay_millis DESC
----

=== Time-Windowed Delay Analysis SQL

[source,sql]
----
SELECT 
  TUMBLE_START(event_time, INTERVAL '1' HOUR) AS window_start, 
  TUMBLE_END(event_time, INTERVAL '1' HOUR) AS window_end, 
  origin, 
  COUNT(*) AS departure_count, 
  SUM(CASE WHEN actualDeparture > scheduledDeparture THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS delayed_count, 
  (SUM(CASE WHEN actualDeparture > scheduledDeparture THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS delay_percentage 
FROM flight_source 
WHERE actualDeparture IS NOT NULL 
GROUP BY TUMBLE(event_time, INTERVAL '1' HOUR), origin 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5
