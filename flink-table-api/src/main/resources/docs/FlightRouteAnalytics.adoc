= Flight Route Analytics Use Case
:toc:
:icons: font
:source-highlighter: highlightjs

== Overview üåü

The Flight Route Analytics use case demonstrates how to analyze flight routes to identify popular origin-destination pairs and airline service patterns.
This use case showcases stateless stream processing with Flink's Table API, helping stakeholders understand route frequency and airline coverage.

== Features üó∫Ô∏è

* Identify popular routes by counting flights between origin and destination pairs
* Determine which airlines service which routes most frequently
* Provide insights into route popularity for better resource allocation

== Implementation Details üîß

The implementation processes flight records by:

1. **Route Popularity Analysis**:
   * Group flights by origin and destination
   * Count the number of flights for each route
   * Order results by frequency to highlight the most popular routes

2. **Airline Route Coverage Analysis**:
   * Group flights by airline, origin, and destination
   * Count the number of flights for each airline-route combination
   * Order results to show each airline's most frequently serviced routes

== Sample Output üìä

== Table API Examples üíª

=== Route Popularity Implementation

[source,java]
----
Table routePopularity = tableEnv.from("flight_source")
    .groupBy($("origin"), $("destination"))
    .select(
        $("origin"),
        $("destination"),
        $("origin").count().as("flight_count")
    )
    .orderBy($("flight_count").desc());
----

=== Airline Route Coverage Implementation

[source,java]
----
Table airlineRoutes = tableEnv.from("flight_source")
    .groupBy($("airline"), $("origin"), $("destination"))
    .select(
        $("airline"),
        $("origin"),
        $("destination"),
        $("airline").count().as("flight_count")
    )
    .orderBy($("airline"), $("flight_count").desc());
----

== Alternative SQL Queries üìù

=== Route Popularity SQL

[source,sql]
----
SELECT origin, destination, COUNT(*) AS flight_count 
FROM flight_source 
GROUP BY origin, destination 
ORDER BY flight_count DESC
----

=== Airline Route Coverage SQL

[source,sql]
----
SELECT airline, origin, destination, COUNT(*) AS flight_count 
FROM flight_source 
GROUP BY airline, origin, destination 
ORDER BY airline, flight_count DESC
----

== Running the Example üöÄ

=== Prerequisites

* Apache Flink 1.20.0 installed
* Kafka running with the flight data topic
* Flight data in Avro format being published to Kafka

=== Command

[source,bash]
----
# Run just the Flight Route Analytics use case
java -jar flink-sql.jar routes [local|cloud] [topic_name]

# Default values will be used if parameters are omitted
# - Environment: local
# - Topic: flights
----

== Key Benefits üéØ

* **Network Planning**: Helps airlines identify profitable routes and optimize their networks
* **Resource Allocation**: Enables airports to allocate resources based on route popularity
* **Competitive Analysis**: Provides insights into which airlines dominate specific routes
* **Strategic Decision Making**: Supports data-driven decisions about new routes or service increases
