This module provides a SQL-only approach to analyze flight data using Apache Flink SQL.

== Overview ℹ️

The Flink SQL module allows you to:

* Run SQL queries against streaming flight data
* Perform real-time analytics on flight delays and routes
* Define and manage Kafka topics through SQL DDL statements
* Create dashboards from continuous queries

== Getting Started 🚀

=== Prerequisites

* Docker and Docker Compose installed
* Kafka and Schema Registry running

=== Running the SQL Client

1. Start all services including Flink components:
+
[source,bash]
----
make docker-up
----

2. Start the interactive SQL client:
+
[source,bash]
----
make flink-sql-client
----

3. Execute a specific SQL use case:
+
[source,bash]
----
make flink-sql-execute SQL_FILE=usecases/airline_delays.sql
----

== Use Cases 📊

=== Airline Delay Analytics

This use case analyzes flight delays by airline and calculates metrics like:

* Average delay time
* Number of delayed flights
* Delay percentage

Run with:
[source,bash]
----
make flink-sql-execute SQL_FILE=usecases/airline_delays.sql
----

=== Flight Status Dashboard

Creates a real-time dashboard with enriched flight information including:

* Flight details (airline, flight number)
* Origin and destination with city names
* Current status and delay information

Run with:
[source,bash]
----
make flink-sql-execute SQL_FILE=usecases/flight_status.sql
----

=== Flight Route Analytics

Analyzes flight routes and calculates statistics like:

* Number of flights per route
* Average delay by route

Run with:
[source,bash]
----
make flink-sql-execute SQL_FILE=usecases/flight_routes.sql
----

== Sample Queries 🔍

The `queries` directory contains sample queries you can run against the created tables:

* `delay_analytics.sql` - Queries for analyzing airline delays
* `status_dashboard.sql` - Queries for flight status monitoring

Run these after setting up the corresponding use case.
