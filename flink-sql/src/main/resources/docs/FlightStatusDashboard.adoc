= Flight Status Dashboard Use Case
:toc:
:icons: font
:source-highlighter: highlightjs

== Overview 🌟

The Flight Status Dashboard demonstrates real-time monitoring of flight statuses using Flink's Table API.
This use case showcases stateless stream processing by grouping flights by their status and counting them in real-time.

== Features ✈️

* Group flights by status (on-time, delayed, canceled, etc.)
* Calculate the count of flights in each status category
* Update the dashboard in real-time as new data arrives

== Implementation Details 🔧

The implementation uses the Table API to create a dynamic table from a Kafka source with Avro-formatted flight data.
It processes incoming flight records by grouping them according to their status field and counting the number of flights in each group.

== Sample Output 📊

[source]
----
+-------------+-------+
|    Status   | Count |
+-------------+-------+
| ON_TIME     |  127  |
| DELAYED     |   43  |
| CANCELLED   |   12  |
| DIVERTED    |    3  |
| IN_AIR      |   78  |

== Table API Example 💻

The core implementation using the Table API:

[source,java]
----
Table statusDashboard = tableEnv.from("flight_source")
    .groupBy($("status"))
    .select(
        $("status"),
        $("status").count().as("count")
    );
----

== Alternative SQL Query 📝

The equivalent SQL implementation:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT status, COUNT(*) AS count 
FROM flight_source 
GROUP BY status
----

== Running the Example 🚀

=== Prerequisites

* Apache Flink 1.20.0 installed
* Kafka running with the flight data topic
* Flight data in Avro format being published to Kafka

=== Command

[source,bash]
----
# Run just the Flight Status Dashboard use case
java -jar flink-sql.jar status [local|cloud] [topic_name]

# Default values will be used if parameters are omitted
# - Environment: local
# - Topic: flights
----

== Key Benefits 🎯

* **Real-time Insights**: Immediate visibility into the current distribution of flight statuses
* **Simple Implementation**: Demonstrates the power of Flink's Table API with minimal code
* **Operational Value**: Provides valuable information for airport operations and airline staff
